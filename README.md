# Mine

Originally it was [an entry](https://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1555) for a JS1K competition by [Philippe Deschaseaux](http://ehouais.net/). Entry's name was Strange Crystals 2.

I've experimented with the sourcode a lot, [this blog](http://ehouais.net/2013/04/js1k-2013-part-1-introduction) helped to understand the code.

## Modifications I made

- Added more furbes with colored lights
- Added cables on the left wall
- Made the rails more shiny
- Tweaked here and there
